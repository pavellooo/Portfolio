# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Logan Pavelschak, and I am a CS student who is especially passionate about cybersecurity.
Here you will find some of my proudest class projects, and I plan to add my personal programming and cybersecurity projects once they are completed!
I am currently working on an undergraduate research project on passkey security, and that will be uploaded here as it progresses as well.
