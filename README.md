# Portfolio
Hi, my name is Logan Pavelschak, and I am a CS student who is especially passionate about cybersecurity.
Here you will find some of my proudest class projects from the past. This Spring 2026 semester, I am working on multiple large programming projects, notably in JavaScript and Kotlin. I also have some small personal projects I have worked on in my (very limited) free time, such as a Unity game project in C#. Once they are finished up, they will be uploaded and linked in this repository!

I am also working on an agentic LLM data transformation tool for a private client for my Capstone project class. I signed an NDA, but once the project is finished, I will publish details on my experience as much as the client allows.

# Research
I am currently working on an undergraduate research project on passkey security, and it is currently deployed as a client-rendered web app. The repository may be found on my profile, and is named "TTTPasskey". The associated research paper will also be linked in this portfolio after it is is peer reviewed and published by the IEEE organization.
